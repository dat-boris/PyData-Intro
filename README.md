Many of you may have heard about NumPy, SciPy, and sklearn. Under the hood, a lot of smartness which can be attributed by many different projects, and languages.

We shall traverse the Python Data (aka PyData) stack, from high level wrapper with Jupyter notebook, down to the low level of optimization used in Numba to translate python into LLVM to allow native execution. It will let you make better use of Python as a numerical tool and preach more cool python to others.
